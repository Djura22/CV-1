## About Me

I am a Software Engineer from Brighton freshly graduated from Software Engineering at Makers Academy, London. My interest was initially piqued after spending several years working as a Music Producer and Audio Engineer.
After working in the music industry for 7 years with artists such as Morcheeba, Yonaka and UNKLE, I found myself looking for new challenges. 
Now I have completed my time at Makers Academy I am on the hunt for my first professional role in Software Development.

I have also spent many years working in the financial sector as a Collections Executive and AR Officer.
During my time at McLean Delmo Bentleys, I streamlined their entire system of reporting client debt.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

During my time spent as an Audio Engineer and Music Producer I developed a very keen eye for recognising problems early and finding solutions fast.
This was then carried over into my work in Accounts where my eye for detail and experience with identifying problems left me in a good position at McLean Delmo Bentleys.
As their principal Collections Executive I streamlined and modernised their method of reporting aged client debt.
I have found my commitment to this skill in particular has been a considerable advantage for me whilst studying software development.

#### Process

Commitment to producing results.



#### Communication/Diplomacy

Through my commitment to transparency and unique experience working with indivudals from the financial world and the arts, I have cultivated a consistent ability to develop solid and lasting client relationships and a solid reputation for being someone people can rely on for honest and constructive contributions to my team.
