## About Me

I am a Software Engineer from Brighton freshly graduated from Software Engineering at Makers Academy, London. My interest was initially piqued after spending several years working as a Music Producer and Audio Engineer.
After working in the music industry for 7 years with artists such as Morcheeba, Yonaka and UNKLE, I found myself looking for new challenges. 
Now I have completed my time at Makers Academy I am on the hunt for my first professional role in Software Development.

I have also spent many years working in the financial sector as a Collections Executive and AR Officer.
During my time at McLean Delmo Bentleys, I streamlined their entire system of reporting client debt.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

During my time spent as an Audio Engineer and Music Producer I developed a very keen eye for recognising problems early and finding solutions fast.
Whilst the skills I developed working as an engineer with both hardware and software were specialised, 
they have been a considerable advantage for me whilst studying software development.
