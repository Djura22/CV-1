## Michael Groves

I am a Software Engineer from East London, currently enrolled on a Bootcamp in Software Engineering at Makers Academy, London. I fell in love with software engineering and programming after spending several years working as a Music Producer and Audio Engineer, working with Artists such as Morcheeba, Yonaka and UNKLE.
Whilst initially dealing with primarily hardware, The world of software 'plugins' took off, offering me a chance to replicate many of the sounds I was creating with decade old hardware in just a single software plugin.
This bred an unending passion and curiosity with all things software within me, and has led me now down the path of software engineering.

I have also spent many years working in the financial sector as a Collections Executive and AR Officer.
During my time at McLean Delmo Bentleys, I modernised their system of reporting client debt by inplimenting VBA in Excel due to the great deal of time and paper that was spent on issuing these daily reports for meetings at the company.
