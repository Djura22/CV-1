## About Me

I am a Software Engineer from Brighton freshly graduated from Software Engineering at Makers Academy, London. My interest was initially piqued after spending several years working as a Music Producer and Audio Engineer.
After working in the music industry for 7 years with artists such as Morcheeba, Yonaka and UNKLE, I found myself looking for new challenges. 
Now I have completed my time at Makers Academy I am on the hunt for my first professional role in Software Development.

I have also spent many years working in the financial sector as a Collections Executive and AR Officer.
During my time at McLean Delmo Bentleys, I streamlined their entire system of reporting client debt.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

During my time spent as an Audio Engineer and Music Producer I developed a very keen eye for recognising problems early and finding solutions fast.
A common problem would be recognising undesirable audio 'artifacts', isolating them and removing them with EQ or finding the source. The source could be hardware or
a software issue, once found I would troubleshoot the issue until it's removed.
This was then carried over into my work in Accounts where my eye for detail and experience with identifying problems left me in a good position at McLean Delmo Bentleys.
As their principal Collections Executive I streamlined and modernised their method of reporting aged client debt.
I have found my commitment to this skill in particular has been a considerable advantage for me whilst studying software development.

#### Communication/Diplomacy

Through my commitment to transparency and unique experience working with individuals from the financial world and the arts, I have cultivated a consistent ability to develop solid and lasting client relationships and a solid reputation for being someone people can rely on for honest and constructive contributions to my team.
During my time working for McLean Delmo Bentleys I had the difficult task of managing targets set by the CFO to collect aged debt whilst ensuring partner client relationships at the firm remained strong. This resulted in being placed often in the middle of any disputes and required a firm but open approach to diplomacy in resolving any conflicts.

#### Process

Agile Processes <br>
A firm commitment to Test Driven Development. <br>
| [Bank Test](https://github.com/Djura22/bank_tech_test_javascript) | An Example of using a TDD approach to constructing a Bank Account. <br>
Project Planning: user stories, database structure and relationships, mock-ups.
Team Processes: pairing, mobbing, retros, check-ins.
Solid commitment to industry-standard best practices ensuring clean, efficient, readable code (Single Responsibility, DRY).

#### Public Speaking

I have always found public speaking to be something which came naturally to me, and which lead me to a brief stint in Theatre where I performed as the lead in a production of 'Hair' at the London Palladium. My time working as a vocalist in a touring band has also allowed me to further strengthen my confidence and ability to speak clearly and to engage with large groups of people.
